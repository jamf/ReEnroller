<div id="main_body" style="position:relative;">
<div style="font-family:Arial;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;color:#000000;">
    <div>Use the ReEnroller app to generate a custom Quickadd package for your clients to (re)enroll the Mac.  Packages can be created to help migrate from one server to another or perform an initial enrollment.</div>
<ul style="margin-left:17px;line-height: 1.4;">
    <li>Enter the URL and Jamf administrator credentials, or an account with at least enrollment privileges, for the new Jamf server.</li>
    <li>If you wish to retain the existing management account and the password enter those credentials.&nbsp; If you wish to change the management account and or password, or wish to use a random password a new management account must be entered.&nbsp; This must be an account not currently on the machine, it will be created during (re)enrollment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    <li>If you choose to add a configuration profile either browse to the file or drag it in.&nbsp; A common profile may include a WiFi payload used to maintain network connectivity during the re-enrollment process. Note, 802.1x profiles are not supported.</li>
    <li>If you wish to generate a package for an initial enrollment check 'Use for new enrollment'.</li>
    <li>For machines that were enrolled through DEP and have &lsquo;Allow MDM Profile Removal&rsquo; unchecked, you need to check the box &lsquo;Remove profiles marked in DEP as not to be removed&rsquo;.  Note, starting with High Sierra (10.13) this option no longer works if SIP is enabled.</li>
    <li>Select appropriate Site options.&nbsp; If the computer account already exists on the destination server with a Site assignemt, the Site may be preserved during re-enrollment.&nbsp; You're also able to select the Site to migrate the system into.</li>
    <li>To automatically create the policy used on the destination server to verity enrollment check the 'Create Migration Complete policy' box.</li>
    <li>If APNs is not being used on the destination server, or you wish to skip the APNs test for some other reason, check the box 'Skip MDM verification'.</li>
    <li>If you'd like to run a specific policy after migration has been verified and recon is complete select the option to do so.  Be sure to use the correct policy id from the policy on the destination server.</li>
    <li>By default the package cleans up once migration is complete.&nbsp; If you'd like to keep things in place uncheck the box for removing the ReEnroller folder.</li>
    <li>If desired set the number of time the client will try the enrollment process in the event it fails for some reason.  Leaving the field blank will set the client to keep retrying until successful.</li>
    <li>Set an interval for the process to retry re-enrollment (5 minutes or greater) in the event it fails, or keep the default of 30 minutes.  You are able to separate the launch daemon/postinstall script from the re-enrollment application by checking the box, 'Create Separate Package'.  With the box checked 2 packages will be created, one with the launchdaemon and postinstall script, the other with the re-enrollment application and settings.  This allows one to stage the application then deploy the launch daemon at a later date, or create a custom launch daemon, say to repair enrollments that have failed over time.</li>

Each package is ready to be deployed with a policy on the Jamf Server.</div>

    As the re-enrollment process kicks off the client will attempt to download, and use, the jamf binary from the new Jamf server.  If the download fails it will rely on the existing jamf binary.  Existing configurations will be backed up to /Library/Application Support/JAMF/ReEnroller/backup.  Upon successful re-enrollment the backups will be deleted, if the re-enrollment fails the backups will be restored.
<div><hr></div>
To verify the machine successfully migrated a 'Migration Complete' policy must exist on the new server, scoped to all managed clients.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier this policy may be created automatically.&nbsp; If you wish to create it manually it must, at a minimum, contain a Files and Processes payload.&nbsp; On the policy General tab configure a Custom Event (jpsmigrationcheck) and Execution Frequency (Ongoing) as illustrated below:

Jamf School migrations require the following information from your Jamf School instance:

<li>Category - Name: Jamf School Unenroll</li>
<li>Script - Name: Jamf School Unenroll</li>
<li>Policy - Name: Jamf School Unenroll</li>

Note, these objects are not updated when new packages are built and must be deleted from Jamf Pro if say you change the API key.

Starting with 10.13 Apple added /var/db/ConfigurationProfiles to SIP.  To ensure the MDM payload is removed additional setup is required, creating a script and policy for MDM removal.

    Create a policy to deploy the script on the source server (server you are migrating from).  <b>The policy must have a custom trigger of apiMDM_remove</b>.  Also set the policy to Ongoing.
<div id="jpsImage2">

        The script requires 2 parameters, a Jamf server username and password, if the MDM profile is to be removed prior to enrolling in the new serve.  Set the script/policy up on the server being unenrolled from.  The account must have at least Computers Create and Read (Jamf Pro Server Objects) along with Send Computer Unmanage Command (Jamf Pro Server Actions). The account is always set up on the server being unenrolled from.<p>
    
    A third parameter may be also be provided, the current Jamf server the client has received it's MDM profile from.  If the parameter is not provided the server will be read from com.jamfsoftware.jamf.plist.  <strong>If the MDM profile is removed after enrollment in the new server the Jamf URL parameter must be provided, the URL being the server the client was migrated from.  The script/policy must also be set up on the destination server.</strong>
<div id="jpsImage2">
<img src="images/mdmRemove_script.png" alt=""></div>
</div>
    The script could also be added to the policy that deploys the reEnrollment package. Be mindful that once the MDM profile is removed all other profiles will be removed, potentially impacting the user experience.
